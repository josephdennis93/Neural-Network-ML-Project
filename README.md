# onion
Dataset of The Onion articles and real "Onion-like" news articles from the subreddit r/NotTheOnion, along with a jupyter notebook extracting the dataset and performing classification. The Onion articles are labeled 1 and the r/NotTheOnion articles are labeled 0.

The model appeared to overfit after the first few epochs, but still achieved ~83% accuracy when tested using the test data set (which is probably a lot better than many of the readers of these subreddits!)
